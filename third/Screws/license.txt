Screws.m is a Mathematica package for performing screw calculus.
It follows the treatment described in _A Mathematical Introduction to
Robotic Manipulation_, by R. M. Murray, Z. Li, and S. S. Sastry
(CRC Press, 1994).  This package implements screw theory in
3-dimensional Euclidean space (some functions work in n dimensions).

RobotLinks.m is a Mathematica package for performing screw calculus.
It uses the basic functions defined in Screws.m to implement some
common function in robot kinematics. It follows the treatment described
Chapter 3 of _A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation_,
by R. M. Murray, Z. Li, and S. S. Sastry (CRC Press, 1994).
